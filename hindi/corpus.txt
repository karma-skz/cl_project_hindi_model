 आज ही एक भिखारी मुस्लिम औरत मिली थी इसी उम्र के बच्चे को गोदी में उठाए हुए। बच्चा सो रहा था। मैंने पूछा सबके बच्चे हमेशा सोते क्यों रहते हैं। वो कुछ नहीं बोली। मैं आधार कार्ड भी मांगने की सोच रहा था इसने में मेरी वाइफ को इस पर दया आ गई और उसने 10 रुपए से दिए। और आज ही तुम्हारी यह वीडियो आ गई। बहुत अच्छा काम किया जागरूक करने का
 Apki videos se bahut kuch sikhne ko milta hi
 itne bure log kaise ho skte hn so sad

 And one more thing to remember: if a beggar takes you somewhere saying that his family stays there dont go Avoid it as it could be a trap for the peoples So be careful And thank you dhruv sir for giving us importance us Jai hind Jai bharat
 I once saw two little girls outside a vegetable marketone just a year oldbeing slapped by a woman trying to snatch coins from them When I questioned her she rudely dismissed me possibly because of political backing It was heartbreaking Ive also seen in places like Shirdi that if you give money to one beggar many others crowd around you making it very uncomfortable Watching your video helped me understand these situations betterthank you so much for shedding light on this
 its true just realized two beggars near my college have identical damages on their hands and face their fingers were broken Hats off
 Concealing a problem never resolves it only confronting it does
 रुह कांप गयी इस video को Dekhane Ke Baad
 Good job bro
 ध्रुव राठी के इस जबरदस्त भयानक सनसनीखेज खुलासे के बाद तो मुझे अब हमारे देश पर राज कर रहे महामानव वीर बहादुर वैज्ञानिक तेजस्वी बुद्धिमान चंदाचोर फेकू मां गंगा के बेटे नॉन बायोलॉजिकल अवतार पुरुष महान व्यक्ति के बारे में सोच कर बड़ा ही दुख होता है और उस पर तरस आता है कि उस बेचारे रेलवे स्टेशन पर चाय बेची मां घरों में बर्तन मांजती थी बेचारे ने कैसे 35 साल तक भिक्षा मांग कर खाया और अपने दो गुजराती मालिकों का भी पेट भरा उस बेचारे गुजराती बालक के बारे में सोच कर मेरा हृदय चीत्कार उठा है
